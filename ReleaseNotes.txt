* For BE use BE=1

   -) The BootRom header files are located in the source root directory:
	-> dramregs_400rd_A.txt
	-> dramregs_400db_A.txt
	-> dramregs_200rd_A.txt
	-> dramregs_200db_A.txt
	-> dramregs_200db619x_A.txt
	-> dramregs_200db6280_A.txt

      The files have predefined register settings for the different SDRAM configurations and required errata. 
      The matching header file is appended to the U-boot image during the make process according to the device
      and board type, using the doimage utility which is located in the /tools directory. The output file to be
      burnt on boot ROM depends on the make parameters:
	-> NBOOT=1 : u-boot-<board name>_<SDRAM clock frequency>_nand.bin
	-> SPIBOOT=1 : u-boot-<board name>_<SDRAM clock frequency>_flash.bin
	
      The file u-boot-<board name>_<SDRAM clock frequency>_uart.bin is used for debug purposes for booting the 
      U-boot image through the UART port. 

   Burning U-Boot
   ==============

   If burning the new U-Boot image to an board the already runs a previous U-Boot image the following sequence
   can be used to load the image using tftp to the board and burn it:
	1. Start a tftp server on the host PC, whose directory is set to point to the directory contaning the 
	   new U-Boot bin image.
	2. Connect an Ethernet cable to the RJ-45 connector of the board.
	3. Configure the U-Boot environment parameters using the following commands:
		> setenv serverip xx.xx.xx.xx	(xx.xx.xx.xx should be the IP address of the PC runing the tftp server)
		> setenv ipaddr yy.yy.yy.yy     (yy.yy.yy.yy should be some IP address with the same subnet as the server)
	4. run the bubt command to load and burn the U-Boot image:
		> bubt u-boot-<board name>_<SDRAM clock frequency>_<boot device>.bin
	5. Once the image is loaded the user is asked whether the environment parameters should be overwritten or not
	   , and answering y or n to thios question will start the burn process.
	6. Once the burn is complete the board can be restarted, and the new U-Boot image will be run.
	
	*** When upgrading U-boot from an older revision than 3.4.10, then after step 6 is done and U-boot 3.4.10 is up and running
	    need to repeat steps 3-6 again on the same image of U-boot 3.4.10 (and up) and re-burn it. The reason is that from U-boot
            3.4.10 and on NAND ECC uses 4-bit for the U-boot image and environment in the NAND, and when using an older U-boot to burn
            it, it is written using 1-bit ECC, which is not correct. Using the newly burnt U-boot 3.4.10 (and on) to burn the image 
            again will use 4-bit ECC.

   In case the original U-Boot image was damaged, or when whishing to burn a different boot device than the current one, 
   the U-Boot command cannot be used, and a debugger is required to load the U-Boot ELF image into the SDRAM, using the 
   following procedure:
	1. Connect a debugger (Marvell uses a Lauterbach debugger, so the supplied scripts are written for this type of debugger)
	   to the debugger port of the board.
	2. From the file menue of the debugger SW choose the "run batch file" option and load the cmm file suiting the system:
		- kw_dimm400.cmm for 88F6281 running at frequencies above 200MHz.
		- kw_dimm200.cmm for all other options.
	3. From the file menue of the debugger SW choose the "load" option and load the U-Boot ELF file (The one without any extension).
	4. Once the loading is done change the following using the debugger SW:
		- CPU PC to 0x670000.
		- Configure the required MPPs to either NAND or SPI according to the required boot method using the debugger SW command line:
			+ For NAND boot:
				- D.S SD:0xD0010000 %LE %LONG 0x01111111
				- D.S SD:0xD0010008 %LE %LONG 0x551111
			+ For SPI boot:
				- For DB-6180, DB-6280 and RD-6192:
					+ D.S SD:0xD0010000 %LE %LONG 0x01112222
				  For all other boards:
					+ D.S SD:0xD0010000 %LE %LONG 0x21112220
				- D.S SD:0xD0010008 %LE %LONG 0x551111
	5. Start the CPU by pressing "Go" in the debugger SW, and the loaded U-Boot image will boot the board, and now the new image can
	   be burnt to the required boot device using the bubt command.

4. Recovery and Upgrade of Linux Image using USB Flash Drive
============================================================

        4.1 Requirements:
        -----------------
        - UBOOT 
        - Flash drive 
        - Kernel compiled with ram_disk support. 
        - Static mapping (Kernel) or dynamic mapping (Uboot) of your MTD flash partitions. 
                
        4.2 Introduction:
        -----------------        
        Today, in order to “burn” a new file system we need to have NFS server with TFTP server,
        this way is too complex and takes long time for setting up and configuring, and usually requires  additional hardware.
        In order to simplify the process UBOOT contains USB recovery feature (the older tftp method is also supported in case recovery is
        executed and no flash drive is inserted), it enables you to put “flashware” image on USB, Load the image from the UBOOT level 
        and boot Linux.
        
        4.3 Recovery Process:
        ---------------------
        1. Power on 
        2. If flash drive is inserted into the USB connector the UBOOT searches for flashware.img file (On either FAT or ext2 FS). 
        3. If flashware.img exists the UBOOT will load the file to RAM starting from $loadaddr ( 0x2000000 ) 
        4. When finished loading the image to RAM the UBOOT will invoke new bootcmd (Based on the image parameters, the below line is an example): 
                setenv bootargs $(console) root=/dev/ram0 rootfstype=squashfs initrd=0x2200000,0x626d64c ramdisk_size=100789 recovery=usb ser 
                verip=10.4.50.5; bootm 0x2000000;          
        
        * The USB flash drive should contain recovery image – squashfs and the file system image.        
          For example:        
               - flashware.img (30M) – basic squashfs rootfs 
               - ubuntu_9.0.4_jffs2 – (140M) – your SW image.          
        
          You can add more files as needed          
        
        4.4 How to create the recovery image? 
        -------------------------------------
        create basic squashfs from your minimal root file system (Ubuntu, RedHat, etc) with mkfs.squashfs 
        Change the init scripts of the filesystem to mount the flash drive and flash_erase, nand_write your SW image. 
        Reboot – the UBOOT will load the default bootcmd.
